Thanks for deciding to contribute and help open source technologies!

Here's the workflow:

1. fork [any of the Storm Enroute projects](https://github.com/storm-enroute) and start coding
2. submit a pull request to the `master` branch.
3. the pull request is tested by Travis
4. after passing the tests and reviews, it will be merged into the `master` branch of the corresponding repository
6. the snapshot of the corresponding project is then updated and deployed -- and you can start using your changes right away

Make sure to read the detailed [styleguide](/dev/styleguide/) on coding conventions,
and the open source license of the project you wish to contribute to.
