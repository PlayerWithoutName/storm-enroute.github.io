Reactress is a concurrent reactive programming framework for Scala, based on the concepts of reactive values and reactive isolates.
Software that is reactive in nature, such as UIs, game engines or web servers, can be concisely expressed with Reactress.
Scala Specialization and mutable reactive values ensure that it is particularly friendly to GC -- Reactress is well suited for building soft real-time systems.
