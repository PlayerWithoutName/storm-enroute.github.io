Thanks for deciding to contribute and help open source technologies!

Feel free to fork [any of the Storm Enroute projects](https://github.com/storm-enroute) and start coding.
Once you're done,
submit a pull request to the `dev` branch.
After passing the tests and reviews,
it will be merged into the `dev` branch of the corresponding repository,
and subsequently into `master`.
Once this happens, the snapshot of the corresponding project is automatically updated and deployed --
and you can start using your changes right away.

Make sure to read the detailed [styleguide](/dev/styleguide/) on coding conventions,
and the open source license of the project you wish to contribute to.
